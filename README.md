Developed market research, utilizing supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and geographical visualizations with Python and Tableau.

## Context

In 2019, around 14 million guests visited the capital of Germany, and the number of overnight stays rose to 34.1 million. Exploring the characteristics and the ratings of the listings in the city may help potential customers and hosts determine the best price range.
